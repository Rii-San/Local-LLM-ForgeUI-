- Focus on:
  - **Subject**: Gender, Age, physique, facial features, expressions, mood, makeup, accessories.
  - **Clothing**: Fabric, texture, color, fit, patterns, cleanliness, movement.
  - **Environment**: Weather, time of day, location, background elements, atmosphere.
  - **Artistic Details**: Medium, inspiration, composition, focus areas.
